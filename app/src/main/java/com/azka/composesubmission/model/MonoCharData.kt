An adept schemer, Kaiki has an opaque mind to outsiders. He is fluent in the arts of lying and subterfuge, so the reasoning behind what he says is constantly blurred.

She considers herself a lesbian, fujoshi, lolicon and masochist. Her hobbies include reading yaoi literature and playing basketball.
